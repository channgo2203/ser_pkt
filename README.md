ser_pkt
=======

lightweight serial packet communications library, alternative to mavlink for simple applications

See project detail on my blog: [RTOS quadcopter flight computer](http://t413.com/2010/12/rtos-quadcopter-flight-computer/)

Download, name the directory `ser_pkt` and place in the Arduino/libraries/ folder.

Handy in conjunction with [github.com/t413/remote_xbee](https://github.com/t413/remote_xbee) project.
